# Image detection - Neural Networks
 Detecting and counting weat heads from pictures
This work has as a final objective to create a model to detect the wheat heads in the images 
indicating how many and where those wheat heads are located.  Therefore our objective is to create
 a tool capable of executing two processes:

•	Object verification: There are wheat heads in the image ? How many ?
•	Object detection: Where are wheat heads in the image ?
